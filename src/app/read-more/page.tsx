            <h1 className="h1">CALCULAS</h1>
            <p>
            Calculus is a branch of mathematics focused on studying change and motion, primarily through the concepts of derivatives and integrals. Developed in the late 17th century by mathematicians Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, calculus has become essential in fields ranging from physics and engineering to economics and biology.

There are two main branches of calculus:

Differential Calculus, which deals with the concept of the derivative, a measure of how a function changes as its input changes. This is often used to find rates of change, such as velocity or growth rate.
Integral Calculus, which focuses on accumulation and the area under curves. It is used to calculate quantities such as areas, volumes, and other accumulations over intervals.
Together, derivatives and integrals form the "Fundamental Theorem of Calculus," connecting the two concepts and providing tools for solving complex problems related to change and accumulation. Calculus is foundational in science and engineering, supporting fields such as physics, where it helps describe motion, and in economics, where it aids in optimizing resources.

            <h1 className="h1">MECHANIC</h1>
            <p>
            In mathematics, mechanics is often referred to as "mathematical mechanics" or "analytical mechanics." It is the study of the mathematical foundations of physical laws governing the motion of objects. This area combines principles of calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and geometry to model forces and predict motion.

Key areas in mechanics math include:

Classical Mechanics (Newtonian Mechanics): Classical mechanics uses calculus and vector algebra to describe the motion of objects. Newton's laws of motion form the basis, describing how forces result in changes to an object’s motion. Calculus is used to solve problems involving velocity, acceleration, and position over time, while vector analysis helps in understanding force directions and magnitudes.

Lagrangian Mechanics: Developed by Joseph-Louis Lagrange, this branch focuses on energy rather than forces. It is a reformulation of Newtonian mechanics using the Lagrangian function, which is the difference between kinetic and potential energy. The Lagrangian approach simplifies complex mechanical problems, especially for systems with constraints, by using calculus of variations.

Hamiltonian Mechanics: Proposed by William Rowan Hamilton, this branch reformulates mechanics in terms of energy and generalized coordinates. It uses the Hamiltonian function, which represents the total energy of a system. Hamiltonian mechanics is especially useful in advanced fields like quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and celestial mechanics.

Fluid Mechanics: This area applies calculus and differential equations to study the behavior of fluids (liquids and gases). Equations like the Navier-Stokes equations model fluid flow, describing how fluid velocity, pressure, density, and temperature change over space and time.

Continuum Mechanics: Continuum mechanics studies deformable objects, assuming that matter is continuously distributed. It uses partial differential equations to describe properties like stress, strain, and elasticity in materials, and is widely applied in materials science and structural engineering.

Mathematical mechanics provides the tools to model, predict, and analyze real-world problems in physics, engineering, and beyond, often forming the backbone for technology, structural design, and complex motion systems.
